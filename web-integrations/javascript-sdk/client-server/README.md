# Client-Server UID2 or EUID Integration Example using JavaScript SDK

[This example](https://example-jssdk-integ.uidapi.com/) demonstrates how a content publisher can use either the UID2 or EUID services and the corresponding SDK for JavaScript to implement the client-server integration workflow.

- For UID2: [UID2 services](https://unifiedid.com/docs/intro), [UID2 SDK for JavaScript](https://unifiedid.com/docs/sdks/sdk-ref-javascript), [client-server UID2 integration workflow](https://unifiedid.com/docs/guides/integration-javascript-client-server)
- For EUID: [EUID services](https://euid.eu/docs/intro), [EUID SDK for JavaScript](https://euid.eu/docs/sdks/sdk-ref-javascript), [client-server EUID integration workflow](https://euid.eu/docs/guides/integration-javascript-client-server)

This example can be configured for either UID2 or EUID â€” the behavior is determined by your environment variable configuration. You cannot use both simultaneously.

For an example application without using the SDK, see [Server-Side UID2 or EUID Integration Example](../../server-side/README.md).

> NOTE: While the server side of the example application is implemented in JavaScript using node.js, it is not
> a requirement. You can use any technology of your choice and refer to the example application for illustration of the functionality that needs to be implemented.

## Build and Run the Example Application

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

From the repository root directory:

```bash
docker compose up javascript-sdk-client-server
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3032

### Using Docker Build

```bash
docker build -f web-integrations/javascript-sdk/client-server/Dockerfile -t javascript-sdk-client-server .
docker run -it --rm -p 3032:3032 --env-file .env javascript-sdk-client-server
```

The following table lists the environment variables that you must specify to start the application.

### Core Configuration

| Variable | Description | Example Values |
|:---------|:------------|:---------------|
| `UID_SERVER_BASE_URL` | The base URL of the UID2/EUID service. For details, see [Environments](https://unifiedid.com/docs/getting-started/gs-environments) (UID2) or [Environments](https://euid.eu/docs/getting-started/gs-environments) (EUID). | UID2: `https://operator-integ.uidapi.com`<br/>EUID: `https://integ.euid.eu/v2` |
| `UID_API_KEY` | Authentication key for accessing UID2/EUID services. Provided via the UID2 Portal or your integration representative. | Your assigned API key |
| `UID_CLIENT_SECRET` | Private key used with your API key to authenticate your app with UID2/EUID services. Provided via the UID2 Portal or your integration representative. | Your assigned client secret |
| `UID_JS_SDK_URL` | URL to the JavaScript SDK | UID2: `https://cdn.integ.uidapi.com/uid2-sdk-4.0.1.js`<br/>EUID: `https://cdn.integ.euid.eu/euid-sdk-4.0.1.js` |
| `UID_JS_SDK_NAME` | Global variable name for the SDK | UID2: `__uid2`<br/>EUID: `__euid` |

### Display/UI Configuration

| Variable | Description | Example Values |
|:---------|:------------|:---------------|
| `IDENTITY_NAME` | Identity name for UI display | UID2: `UID2`<br/>EUID: `EUID` |
| `DOCS_BASE_URL` | Documentation base URL | UID2: `https://unifiedid.com/docs`<br/>EUID: `https://euid.eu/docs` |


## Test the Example Application

The example application illustrates the steps documented in the integration guides. For an overview of the high-level workflow for establishing UID2/EUID identity, API reference, and cookie format details, see:
- UID2: [UID2 SDK Integration Guide](https://unifiedid.com/docs/guides/publisher-client-side), [UID2 SDK for JavaScript](https://unifiedid.com/docs/sdks/client-side-identity)
- EUID: [EUID SDK Integration Guide](https://euid.eu/docs/guides/publisher-client-side), [EUID SDK for JavaScript](https://euid.eu/docs/sdks/client-side-identity)

**Note:** For API endpoint documentation, see the UID2 or EUID docs based on your configuration.

The following table outlines and annotates the steps you may take to test and explore the example application.
